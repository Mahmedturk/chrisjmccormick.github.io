Radial Basis Function Networks
==============================
I've written a number of posts related to Radial Basis Function Networks. Together, they can be taken as a multi-part tutorial to RBFNs.

[Part 1 - RBFN Basics, RBFNs for Classification][rbfn_classification]
Part 2 - RBFN Example Code in Matlab
Part 3 - RBFN for function approximation

### Advanced Topics
Gaussian Kernel Regression
Mahalonobis Distance
