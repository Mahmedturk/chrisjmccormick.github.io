Hi! I’m a software and research engineer currently working for a startup named in2H2. 

At in2H2, we are developing a unique hardware architecture for accelerating data mining algorithms that are based on distance calculations (such as Euclidean distance or Cosine distance). Specifically, we are targeting performance-constrained applications of k-Nearest Neighbor search and clustering algorithms such as k-Means.

My role is in leading our benchmarking efforts (primarily against high-end GPUs) and our application research. As we look for opportunities for our hardware across different markets, I get to investigate a wide range of algorithms and applications. And, when I can, I like to share what I learn here. I find that one of the best ways, for me, to learn a subject is to try and teach it. You don't realize what you don't know until you try and teach it :).

I always enjoy talking with other people who share an interest in machine learning and related topics; feel free to contact me at chris.mccormick@in2h2.com, though please understand and forgive me if I don't manage to reply.
