Hi! I’m a software engineer currently working at CogniMem Technologies, Inc. As an engineer, my passions lie in machine learning and computer vision, and in particular, the hardware acceleration of machine learning.

At CogniMem, I work as an applications engineer developing proof of concepts for our customers. CogniMem sells a chip which provides a fully parallel and scalable implementation of two machine learning algorithms, RBF Network and KNN. In my role at CogniMem, I also research the latest machine learning and computer vision techniques to apply to customer problems, and share much of what I learn here on my site.
